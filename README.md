# Predicting-stress-using-wearable-sensors
This repository contains code and documentation for a research project focused on predicting stress levels using data collected from wearable devices. The primary indicators analyzed include Heart Rate (HR) and Respiratory Rate (resp). Various machine learning models were implemented, with the Random Forest Classifier showing the best performance in terms of its F1-score.

The dataset is present with 112,516 samples from 34 subjects.
Variables of the dataset include participant ID, HR, resp, time in UNIX timestamp, and a binary stress label.

Below is the link of the dataset.

A Jupyter Notebook file has been attached with this, with all the code.

The prerequisites to run the code are following.

Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

All you have to do is to run the code and it will generate the results for you.
